            <h1>Boxing History</h1>
            <h2>Marquess of Queensberry Rules</h2>
            <p>Boxing as we know it today started in 1867 with the implementation of the Marqess of Queensberry Rules. 
                Some of the main rules that were implemented were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Boxers using gloves</li>
                <li>3 minute rounds with 1 minute rest in between</li>
                <li>10 second count for knockdowns</li>
                <li>No punching or wrestling an opponent who is knocked down</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, boxing was considered to be more of a bare knuckle brawl than a sport. 
                The more sofisticated rules resulted in boxing becoming more mainstream. The boxer who was arguably most famous 
                during this era was John L. Sullivan, who was the last bare knuckle champion and the first heavyweight champion 
                with the new Marquess of Queensberry Rules.</p>

            <h2>Early 1900s</h2>
            <p>Boxing really began to grow as a sport in the early 1900s, especially in the US and UK. 
                There is footage of boxing matches from this era that is available to watch on the internet, 
                and it's during this time that weight classes became more organized. Some notable fighters of 
                this era were Jack Dempsey, who is seen as one of the toughest fighters of all time, and
                Jack Johnson, who was the first black heavyweight boxing champion, which sparked a lot of 
                racial tension in America.

            <h2>Mid 1900s</h2>
            <p>The mid 1900s is when boxing started airing on television, which boosted it's popularity even
                more than previously. Two fighters in the 1950s who stood out from the rest were Rocky Marciano 
                and Sugar Ray Robinson. Rocky Marciano was an undefeated heavyweight champion, and Sugar Ray Robinson 
                was notable for his incredible speed, footwork, and technique. Then in the 1960s came the era of Muhammad Ali 
                who is considered by most people to be the greates boxer of all time. Muhammad Ali shocked the world for the first 
                time when he beat Sonny Liston, who knocked out almost everyone he fought. Ali then shocked the world again 
                later in his career when he came back to boxing and beat George Foreman, who was another boxer that 
                knocked out most people that he fought, and is still considered to be one of the most powerful boxers 
                of all time.

            <h2>Late 1900s</h2>
            <p>The late 1900s was an era of many great heavyweight boxers, most notably Mike Tyson. 
                Mike Tyson became the youngest heavyweight champion ever at 20 years old, and his knockout 
                power made him become feared by most of his opponents. Some of the other famous heavyweights 
                at this time were Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, and Riddick Bowe. These fighters contributed 
                to making this era of the heavyweight division legendary, with all the exciting bouts fought 
                against each other. The lower weight divisions of this era also provided some really exciting 
                fights, mainly between "the four kings" of the middleweight and welterweight divisions. The fighters 
                who were called kings were Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns, and Roberto Duran. 
                They were all among the greatest boxers of all time, and they just happened to compete in the same weight 
                classes, at the same exact time.

        <section id="early2000s">
            <h2>Early 2000s</h2>
            <p>The early 2000s has been quite a transformative period for boxing. In the very beginning of the 2000s, 
                the most popular boxers were Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. Floyd Mayweather is one 
                of the only fighters who never lost in his career. A lot of boxing fans consider him to be the greatest 
                boxer of all time because of this, especially since he beat other great boxers such as Manny Pacquiao, 
                Canelo Alvarez, and Oscar De La Hoya. Unlike powerful knockout fighters like Mike Tyson, Floyd Mayweather relied 
                mainly on his technique and defense to defeat his opponents. Manny Pacquiao is known for having won 
                boxing titles in eight different weight divisions, going up all the way from 112 lbs to 154 lbs. 
                The heavyweight division in this era has been considered to be quite lackluster compared to the 
                great heavyweight era of the late 1900s. However, there has been a revival of the division in the 2020s, 
                with fighters such as Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua, Deontay Wilder and Oleksandr Usyk bringing excitement back 
                to the division. The boxer who is currently considered to be the face of boxing is Canelo Alvarez. 
                From starting his professional boxing career in 2005 at age 15, to still being at the top today, 
                Canelo is a very dominant boxer who have won almost every single fight that he has participated in.
