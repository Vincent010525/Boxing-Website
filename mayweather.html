            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>Floyd Mayweather was a boxer ever since he was a little kid, never really considering doing anything other in his life than 
                pursuing a boxing career. He was trained by his family members, mainly by his uncle Roger Mayweather, who were all previous 
                professional boxers. Floyd Mayweather would ultimately end up being the most successfull boxer in his family. He started of his 
                boxing career by winning a bunch of amateur championships, in 3 different weight classes. He started his professional boxing career 
                at 19 years old, and he dominated every single fight that he had in the beginning of his career. He first became a champion at 21 
                years old, and throughout his career he would become champion in 5 different weight classes. Many people critique Mayweather for 
                choosing his fights very carefully, choosing easy fights. He did, however, fight a lot of skilled fighters throughout his career, 
                and his skill and dominance is undeniable. Some of the best fighters that he fought were Ricky Hatton, Shane Mosley, Miguel Cotto, 
                Marcos Maidana, Canelo Alvarez, Oscar De La Hoya, and Manny Pacquiao, with the last 3 being some of the best boxers of all time. 
                These tough opponents didn't stop Mayweather, since he won every single professional fight that he was in, resulting in him having 
                arguably the most impressive record of all time of 50 wins and 0 losses. His dominance didn't come from power or speed, but it came from 
                his technique and defense, which is probably the greatest of any boxer that has ever lived. Mayweather rarely took any serious damage, 
                which shows today since he is still active fighting exhibition fights, and still dominating all of these fights.

            <h2>Early Career</h2>
            <p>Floyd Mayweather came from a family of boxers, with his father Floyd Maywather Sr. being a skilled boxer who 
                was a contender in the welterweight division, and his two uncles Roger and Jeff Mayweather also being professional 
                boxers. Roger Mayweather was Floyd Mayweather's trainer, and he won 2 world championships and fought many of the 
                all time greats in boxing. Needless to say, boxing is in Floyd Mayweather's blood, and he has been boxing all of his life. 
                He never considered any other profession than boxing, even dropping out of high school because he didn't think there was a reason 
                to go to school when he would be a boxer anyways. Mayweather had a successfull amateur career before turing professional, winning 
                the national Golden Gloves championship in 1993, 1994, and 1996, at 3 different weight classes. He also won a bronze medal in 
                the 1996 olympics in the featherweight division. Mayweather losing in the semifinals was highly controversial, however, since 
                a lot of people consider the judging to be highly biased in favor of Mayweather's opponent. Later in 1996, Floyd Mayweather started 
                his professional boxing career at 19 years old. The fighters that Mayweather faced in the beginning of his career were of 
                quite a low caliber, and in just 2 years he was able to amass 17 victories before getting the chance to fight for a world title.

            <h2>Winning Championships</h2>
            <p>In 1998, when Floyd Mayweather had a record of 17 wins and 0 losses, he got the chance to fight the super featherweight champion 
                Genaro Hernandez. He won the fight in the 8th round, and became champion for the first time. Mayweather would defend this title 9 
                times after becoming champion, winning by a combination of knockouts and decisions. The most notable win amongst these were against 
                Emanuel Augustus in 2000. Augustus had the nickname 'The Drunken Master', because of his strange and unpredictable fighting style, 
                seeming almost like a drunk person. Despite being very unorthodox, Augustus was a master at slipping punches. Mayweather would later 
                say that this was one of the hardest fights of his career. Despite the challenge of Augustus that Mayweather had to deal with, he ended up 
                winning the fight by a knockout in the 9th round. In 2002, Mayweather ended up going up to the lightweight division, at 25 years old. 
                His first fight in the lightweight division was against the champion Jose Luis Castillo. He ended up winning this fight, making him the lightweight 
                champion. He would end up fighting 5 more times in the lightweight division before going up another weight class to super lightweight. He defeated 
                Arturo Gatti in 2005 for the super lightweight title. After this, he moved up yet another weight class to welterweight, fighting for the 
                welterweight title against Zab Judah in 2006. To no surprise, Mayweather won this fight as well. At this point he was 29 years old, and 
                had a record of 36 wins and 0 losses. He defended his title 1 time afterwards before going up to light middleweight to fight the champion 
                Oscar De La Hoya. It was a massive fight, since both Mayweather and De La Hoya were both superstars at this point. It was also arguably the 
                first fight that Mayweather had against an opponent that could be considered as one of the greatest boxers at the time. Despite De La Hoya being bigger 
                and stronger than Mayweather, he still ended up beating De La Hoya in a decision victory.

            <h2>Showing His Dominance</h2>
            <p>After beating Oscar De La Hoya in 2007, Floyd had won championship titles in 4 different weight classes, and was considered by many to 
                be the greatest boxer of his generation. Despite his already successfull career of 38 wins and 0 losses, Mayweather would only go up from here. 
                His next fight was against a great english fighter called Ricky Hatton. Hatton was a really tough fighter, but Mayweather still managed to 
                knock him out in the 10th round. He fought 3 more times in the welterweight division after this, beating the great fighter Shane Mosley, and also 
                having a controversial victory over Victor Ortiz. Ortiz fought really dirty against Mayweather, headbutting him, and hitting him in the back of the head. 
                After he headbutted Mayweather, the referee separated the fighters to give Ortiz a warning. After they were told to start fighting again, Ortiz 
                still had his guard down and tried to apologize to Mayweather. Mayweather, however, took this opportunity to punish Ortiz by sucker punching him 2 times, 
                resulting in Ortiz being knocked out. Many people consider this to be an extremely dirty move by Mayweather, since Ortiz was not prepared for it, but at 
                despite the controversy, what Mayweather did was completely within the rules as the referee had started the fight again. A lot of people also defended 
                Mayweather, claiming that it was Ortiz fault for not defending himself, and for fighting dirty in the first place. After beating Victor Ortiz, Floyd Mayweather 
                won a championship in yet another weight class, the super light middleweight division, against Miguel Cotto. He then had another win, before fighting 
                Canelo Alvarez in 2013, who is considered by many to be the greates boxer in today's era. Canelo was only 23 years old at this time and hadn't really reached his 
                prime yet, but it was still an impressive win for Mayweather nonetheless. He then fought Marcos Maidana twice, beating him twice, to defend the welterweight 
                title. In 2015, he fought Manny Pacquiao. Pacquiao had won world championships in 8 different weight classes, compared to Mayweather's 5. Many people thought that 
                he might be an even better boxer than Mayweather, because of his impressive victories in so many different weight classes. The fight against Pacquiao would end up being 
                Mayweather's last real challenge, and possibly greates challenge ever in his career. Despite the skill of Pacquiao, Mayweather ended up 
                winning the fight. It was now undebatable that Mayweather was the greatest boxer of his generation. He would only have 1 more fight before retiring, and to no 
                surprise, he won the fight at 38 years old. After retiring in 2015, Mayweather would come back to professional boxing for 1 last fight 
                in 2017, against the MMA superstar Conor McGregor. McGregor was arguably even more famous than Floyd Mayweather at the time, and this fight generated the most 
                amount of money from any fight in history. Even though McGregor put up a good fight, especially since he was an MMA fighter and not a boxer, Mayweather would end 
                up easily winning the fight, leaving professional boxing for the last time at 40 years old, with an undefeated record of 50 wins and 0 losses.

            <h2>Exhibition Fights</h2>
            <p>Even though he retired from professional fighting in 2017, Floyd Mayweather is still fighting to this day in exhibition fights. 
                Exhibition fights are not scored boxing fights, meaning that if none of the fighters have either been knocked out or quit in the fight, 
                there is no official winner. Exhibition fights also don't count towards a boxer's record. Mayweather had his first exhibition fight after 
                his professional retirement in 2018, against the japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa, who he knocked out in the first round. He then took a 
                break until 2021, when he fought the famous youtuber Logan Paul. Even though Paul was much bigger than Mayweather, he still beat Paul very easily 
                by simply outboxing him. This was not an official result though, since Mayweather didn't knock out Paul. 2022 was a relatively active year 
                for the retired Mayweather, fighting 3 exhibition fights in the year. His first fight was agains Don Moore, which was unscored since there was 
                no knockout. His next fight was against the mixed martial artist Mikuru Asakura, who he ended up knocking out in the second round. His last fight 
                in 2022 was against another famous youtuber, Deji Olatunji. Mayweather knocked out Olatunji in the 6th round. His next fight was against another 
                MMA fighter, Aaron Chalmers, which didn't result in a knockout. Mayweather's last 2 fights were against John Gotti III, who is an MMA fighter, 
                and the grandson of one of the most famous mobsters of all time, John Gotti. Their first fight got stopped in the 6th round due to a brawl erupting 
                after Gotti got frustrated due to Mayweather dominating the fight. Their next fight went the full distance with no knockout.
