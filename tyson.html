            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>Mike Tyson started of his boxing career after having a rough and criminal childhood. He got discovered by
                his
                trainer and father figure, Cus D'Amato, who trained him to become a ferocious fighter. He would start
                his professional
                career at 18 years old, after having a successfull amateur career. He ended up knocking out almost all
                of his opponent in the
                beginning of his career, many in the first round. When he was only 20 years old, he was undefeated with
                27 wins, and
                won the heavyweight title as the youngest person ever. He then won some more fights before finally
                losing to Buster Douglas.
                He managed to comeback from this loss and won even more fights, before he eventually would spend 4 years
                in prison due to
                a rape conviction. Many people think that getting sent to prison, along with having his father figure
                trainer Cus D'amato pass
                away when he was 19, greatly hurt Tyson's boxing career. He came back to boxing with a few wins after
                getting out of prison, even
                becoming heavyweight champion again. His reign as champion was short lived due to Evander Holyfield, who
                ended up beating Tyson twice,
                something that no other fighter ever did. Tyson's career was pretty much over after this point, with him
                only winning 5 fights
                after the losees to Holyfield, while losing 4 more fights.

            <h2>Early Career</h2>
            <p>Mike Tyson was born in 1966, and had quite the rough childhood. He never really knew his father,
                and his mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict who wasn't the best of parents. Tyson has told in
                interviews
                that she used to give him alcohol and weed to make him fall asleep when he was only 8 years old,
                and he would start drinking alcohol and using drugs outside of the home too. He would also head on a
                criminal
                path, comitting robberies and fighting etc. He was also bullied a lot, and was forced to fight a lot to
                defened himself, sometimes even against adults while he himself was a young kid. At 13 years old,
                Tyson's criminal ways
                had caught up to him, and he was locked up in a juvenile facility. It was there that he got noticed by a
                former boxer,
                who introduced him to the legendary boxing trainer Cus D'Amato. D'Amato recognized the potential in Mike
                Tyson, as
                he was incredibly big, strong, fast, and just overall athletic, especially for a 13 year old boy. He
                took on
                Tyson as a boxing student, and even later became his legal guardian when Tyson's mother passed away, and
                had Tyson stay at his home. From age 13 to 19, Tyson dedicated his life to boxing and to Cus D'Amato who
                considered Tyson to be his golden student who was destined for greatness. Tyson had a great amateur
                career,
                with many dominating victories, before turning pro at 18 years old, in 1985. His dominating victories
                continued in
                his professional career, with the first 19 fights of his career being knockout wins for Tyson, and 12 of
                them
                being first round knockouts. He would win 8 more fights after this before finally getting the chance to
                fight
                for the heavyweight title.

            <h2>Youngest Heavyweight Champion</h2>
            <p>In 1986, when Mike Tyson was only 20 years old, he fought for the heavyweight title against Trevor
                Berbick, who
                was famous for beating Muhammad Ali in his final fight ever. Tyson, like ususal, ended up dominating the
                fight,
                knocking Berbick out in the second round, and becoming the youngest heavyweight champion ever.
                Tragically, however,
                Cus D'Amato who was practically Mike Tyson's father, never got to see Tyson become champion since he
                died a year earlier.
                Tyson had continued his boxing career after the death of his coach and father, and he would continue his
                career
                after becoming champion, but the loss of his mentor combined with becoming extremely famous at such a
                young age
                affected him a lot, and many fans speculate that if Cus D'Amato didn't die, Tyson's career would have
                been even
                greater than it was. But back to Tyson being heavyweight champion, he would defend his title 9 times
                from
                1987 to 1989. In classic Tyson fashion, he knocked out 7 out of his 9 opponents, 2 of them being Larry
                Holmes, who
                was a former heavyweight champion, and Frank Bruno, who later on would become the heavyweight champion
                in 1995.

            <h2>First Loss and Prison</h2>
            <p>In the beginning of 1990, Mike Tyson was still undefeated heavyweight champion with 37 victories. He
                would then go on
                to fight Buster Douglas in February of 1990, and Mike Tyson was a massive favorite as usual, having
                knocked out his 6
                previous opponents. Douglas had famously promised his dying mother that he would beat Tyson and become
                the
                heavyweight champion, which showed in the fight as he fought relentlessly to win the fight, even getting
                up from
                a massive Mike Tyson punch which knocked him down, and would have knocked out most fighters. Douglas got
                back up, however,
                and fought back like crazy. In the 10th round, Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson against all odds,
                leaving Tyson with
                his first ever loss. After the loss, Tyson had 4 more fights in 1990 and 1991, all of which he won. He
                was still not the heavyweight
                champion though, since he hadn't got the opportunty to fight for the title that he lost to Douglas yet.
                After his last fight
                in 1991, Tyson was 24 years old, and had a record of 41 wins and 1 loss. He was about to get the
                opportunity to
                fight for the heavyweight title again, but then he got accused of rape, and got convicted to 6 years in
                prison.
                Tyson always denied the allegations, even after being convicted, and many people to this day believe
                that he
                was falsely accused and convicted. Regardless if he was actually guilty or not, his time in prison where
                he had no opportunity
                to fight, or even train boxing, severely hurt his career.

            <h2>Prison Release and Comeback</h2>
            <p>After being in prison for 4 years, Mike Tyson was released and immediately returned to boxing, fighting
                Peter McNeeley in 1995.
                Tyson won in the first round, proving that he was still a real threat in the ring. Although he couldn't
                do any boxing
                training in jail, he did a lot of weightlifting and was even bigger and stronger than when he had went
                into prison.
                After beating McNeeley, Tyson won 3 more fights, one of them being against Frank Bruno in 1996, who he
                had beaten already, and
                who was now the heavyweight champion. Later in 1996, Tyson would fight Evander Holyfield, who ended up
                being one of his biggest
                rivals. Holyfield was a smaller guy who previously had fought in a lighter weight division, but later on
                ended up going up to
                heavyweight. He was a very skilled boxer, but most people expected Tyson to defeat him and defend his
                heavyweight title.
                Holyfield showed his skills in the fight against Tyson, and ended up beating him, stripping Tyson of his
                heavyweight title.
                One year later in 1997, Tyson got the rematch against Holyfield to try and win back the heavyweight
                title. The fight would only last 3
                rounds, and during those 3 rounds Holyfield fought very dirty, headbutting Tyson multiple times. This
                angered Tyson so much that
                he ended up biting of Holyfield's ear, which obviously resulted in Mike Tyson being disqualified. After
                this fight, Tyson never really
                returned to the great boxer that he once was. He would win 4 more fights from 1999 to 2001, before
                fighting Lennox Lewis in 2002.
                Lewis knocked him out in the 8th round. In 2003, Tyson beat Clifford Etienne, making his record an
                impressive 50 wins and 4 losses.
                He would, however, end up fighting 2 more times before finally retiring in 2005. Tyson unfortunately
                lost both of these fights.
                In 2025, when Tyson was 58 years old, he made a surprising return to boxing, with a fight against Jake
                Paul, who was a 27
                year old youtuber. The fight was very controversial due to the massive age difference, and to no
                surprise, Tyson ended up losing the
                fight.
