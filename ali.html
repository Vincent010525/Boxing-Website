            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Clay) had one of the most fascinating boxing careers of all time. Ali's loud mouth and
                impressive boxing style, moving his feet constantly and hitting his opponents with superhuman speed, resulted in many people 
                being incredibly interested in watching him fight. His fame really skyrocketed in 1964 
                when he beat Sonny Liston, and until 1967 he defended the heavyweight belts. After that, he got banned from boxing 
                because of his refusal to fight in the Vietnam war. This became a big part his life, since he ended up 
                being a big anti war proponent. Another big aspect of Ali's life was in 1964 when he converted to the religion 
                of islam. At the same time, he also changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. After being banned from 
                boxing for 3 years, Ali finally was able to fight again in 1970. He suffered his first loss against Joe Frazier 
                in 1971, which then led to the most famous trilogy in boxing history, with Ali getting his revenge, beating Frazier 
                after 3 years in 1974, and then beating him again in their third and final match in 1975. He continued to dominate 
                until the late 1970s, when he started showing signs of parkinson's disease which he was officially diagnosed with 
                in 1984, 3 years after he retired in 1981.

            <h2>Early Career</h2>
            <p>Muhammad Ali was born in 1942, and he grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, in the US. He started boxing 
                at 12 years old, and by the time he was 18 in 1960, he won an olympic gold medal in the light heavyweight 
                weight class. Ali also started his professional career in 1960 with a decision victory in a 6 round fight 
                against Tunney Hunsaker. From his debut until the end of 1963, Ali was undefeated with 19 victories, 15 via 
                knockout. Some of the most notable fighters he beat during this time were Henry Cooper, Archie Moore, Jim Robinson 
                and Doug Jones. Ali famously talked very highly of himself, and taunted his opponents, in a theatrical way. 
                This behaviour came from the professional wrestler "Gorgeous George", who gave Ali the inspiration to also 
                be loud and very over the top with his performative act in interviews and such. In 1964, got a chance to fight 
                for the heavyweight title against the current champion, Sonny Liston. Liston was a ferocious and terrifying 
                fighter, who had knocked out many great fighters, including two first-round knockouts against Floyd Patterson, 
                who was the previous heavyweight champion. Liston also had a criminal past, and was allegedly a hitman for 
                the mafia in the US. Needles to say, most people thought Ali would have no chance against the champion Sonny Liston, 
                even being an 8 to 1 underdog on the betting odds. Ali ended up proving all the critics wrong by not only winning 
                the fight, but also knocking out Liston. After he beat Liston and became the heavyweight champion for the 
                first time, his stardom increased to a whole new level.

            <h2>Title Reign and Vietnam War</h2>
            <p>After beating Sonny Liston for the first time in 1964, Ali defended his title 9 times before he 
                got banned from boxing in 1967. His first title defense was actually a rematch agains Liston, where he once 
                again knocked Liston out, solidifying his dominance against the former champion. His next fight was against 
                another Floyd Patterson, who was another former heavyweight champion. He continued defending his title against 
                fighters like Henry Cooper and Ernie Terell, before having his final title defense against Zora Folley in 1967 
                before being banned from fighting. During his exile from boxing, Ali would visit colleges to speak out against the war, as well as 
                speaking out about racism against african-americans. A famous moment from this time period in Ali's life was during 
                a court hearing about his refusal to enlist to the armed forces, when the judge called him by his former name "Cassius Clay." The reason why Ali took offense 
                to this was because he considered that to be a slave name that had been given to him by white slave masters. 
                For this reason, he was adamant about the judge calling him Muhammad Ali and not Cassius Clay. In the beginning of 
                the Vietnam war, Ali was heavily criticised by the public and the press for being a draft evader. This later shifted 
                into him being a role model for peace, since the overall view of the invasion of Vietnam became really negative. 
                Ali famously stated that the people of Vietnam had never done him any wrong, while he in fact had been treated really badly 
                by americans instead, with all the racism that he faced.

            <h2>Return to Boxing</h2>
            <p>In 1970 Ali was allowed to return to boxing after his ban for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War. 
                His first two fights were victories against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena. Ultimately, these fights were warm up 
                fights to prepare Ali to fight for the heavyweight titles against the current champion, Joe Frazier. 
                After Muhammad Ali was banned from boxing, he was also stripped of all of his heavyweight titles, which Joe Frazier 
                ended up winning while there was no champion in the division. The boxing fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier 
                was the first fight of what ultimately ended up being a trilogy of fights between the two of them, and it was actually 
                the most famous boxing trilogy of all time. The first fight between them took place in 1971, and it was a war which left 
                both of them hospitalized afterwards. Ali, who was still undefeated with 31 wins at this time, put up a good fight against Frazier, 
                but ultimately ended up loosing against the aggresive Joe Frazier who was relentless in his pushing forwards. 
                Although Ali had lost, he did not lose his spirit, and he still had his mind set on winning back the titles.

            <h2>Domination</h2>
            <p>After the loss against Joe Frazier in 1971, Muhammad Ali went on a 10 fight win streak. The most notable win 
                out of all of those wins were against Floyd Patterson, the former heavyweight champion. This was the second time 
                Ali beat him. Some other notable wins were against Joe Bugner, Bob Foster, and Jerry Quarry for the second 
                time. In 1973 after Ali's 10 fight win streak, he ended up losing a split decision against Ken Norton. This didn't stop 
                him however, since he won the rematch against Ken Norton only 4 months after his defeat. This was the start of the 
                absolute domination of Muhammad Ali. After the win against Ken Norton, Ali won another fight before finally rematching 
                Joe Frazier 3 years after his first defeat. Ali was an underdog in this fight since he had previously been 
                defeated by Frazier, but he still managed to win a unanimous decision, getting his revenge 3 years later. 
                Although Ali got his long awaited victory against his rival, Frazier had lost the titles to George Foreman before 
                Ali fought him, which meant that Ali still hadn't regained the titles after losing them from the Vietnam ban. 
                He didn't let this stop him however, since he now qualified to challenge the champion George Foreman, after his impressive 
                win against Joe Frazier. George Foreman was a terrifying boxer, much like Sonny Liston in that he was incredibly powerful. 
                He actually knocked out Joe Frazier in the first round, which didn't look good for Ali since he lost once against Frazier, 
                and only managed to win by a decision instead of a knockout during their second fight. Needless to say, Ali was an even 
                bigger underdog in the fight against George Foreman than he had been against Joe Frazier. It seemed like the only one 
                who beleived that Ali even had a chance was Ali himself, who like always was supremely confident. He ended up putting up 
                a boxing masterclass against Foreman, dodging all of his punches and tiring him out, until he eventually was able to knock 
                Foreman out in the eight round. Ali had once again shocked the world, and became the heavyweight champion once more. After the 
                Foreman fight, Ali won three more matches before fighting against Joe Frazier in 1975, for the third and final time. Once again, 
                Ali showed his dominance by knocking out Frazier, and ending their 4 year long rivalry. Ali would stay as champion and win all of
                his fights for 3 more years, after finally losing against Leon Spinks in 1978. He ended up beating him only a few months 
                later in a rematch, becoming champion once more. This was however the last victory he would ever have, since 
                he started to be affected by parkinson's, now that he was in his late thirties. In 1980, Ali lost against the champion 
                Larry Holmes, and in 1981 he lost his last ever fight against Trevor Berbick. Even though there was a sad ending to 
                the career of Muhammad Ali, he still had one of the most incredible careers of all time, making him worthy of 
                the title as "The Greatest of All Time."
